### Create a web app of your choosing that uses Web APIs to get and display information
---
### **General Info:**
We decided to use the quote generators to create a web app that displays random quotes from 4 different sources with the ability to save the ones the user loves. If desired, the user can also clear them all out and start over. As a part of a presentation, we were also asked to create powerpoint slides to describe the app, demo the use of it, and discuss our future plans to make it better.

### **Assignments**
Asa: HTML
Tracee: CSS
Matt: JavaScript

### **Challenges**
Some of the documentation on the web api's was sparse or non-existent. The things we want to do in the future to make the app better will require some work to get it to function. Some of the styling from bootstrap was difficult to figure out how to override. 


### **Open Issues**
We have 2 open issues on this project that describe what we would like to add in the future to make the app better.
